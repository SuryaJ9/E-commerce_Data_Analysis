--- Row count

-- Goals gere:
--> See Categories,item names,quantities
--> Confirm data types and NULL values
--> know how many rows you're dealing with.

-- step 2: Data Quality checks:

--- checking missing values:

select

sum(CASE WHEN name IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing,

-- This likely indicates:

-- Data entry error (missing MRP not entered correctly).

-- System default (zeros filled where price wasnâ€™t available).

-- Special cases (e.g., promotional free items, but those should usually be flagged differently).

-- Data cleaning:
-- Identify the how many rows have mrp = 0
select count(*) from zepto where mrp = 0;

-- step 4: Category-Level Analysis

-- Items by category:
select category,

-- Category wise sales

--- step 7: Advanced EDA

-- Correlation Analysis:
-- Example: Higher discounts always linked with out-of-stock items?)
-- Category revenue potential:

select category,

-- price per gram analysis

-- Potential Revenue
